Here is **Yanying Wei (YING, 韦艳莹)**.


I am a graduate from the School of Economics and Management at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), where I obtained a Master's degree in Finance. Under the guidance of Professor [Zuoji Dong](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~dongzuoji?language=en), I delved into the intricacies of financial studies, gaining valuable insights and skills in the field.

Currently, I am a dedicated educator at the School of Digital Economics, Nanning University. As a faculty member in the Financial Technology program, I am passionate about imparting knowledge in various subjects, including Python Programming, Financial Big Data Analysis, and Econometrics.
