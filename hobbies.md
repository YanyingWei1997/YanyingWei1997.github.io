<br> My father took me fishing since I was a child, and I gradually fell in love with this activity. I found that fishing can make me very patient and persevering. 
I also often go mountain climbing with my friends. Mountain climbing can help us keep fit, and we can see different scenery by climbing high.


## Workshop

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give [a fantastic speech], which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].





## My Dog

This is my love. Her name is Lucky(好运).
