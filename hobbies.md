<br> My father took me fishing since I was a child, and I gradually fell in love with this activity. I found that fishing can make me very patient and persevering. 
I also often go mountain climbing with my friends. Mountain climbing can help us keep fit, and we can see different scenery by climbing high.

<br>If you want to gain an in-depth grasp of a particular knowledge, you only need to give a lecture. 
If you can explain to others so that you can fully understand, you are already an expert. 
**Knowledge changes fate.** 
I hope to help others through knowledge. 
I really enjoy the achievement of imparting knowledge, so I strive to become the student's favorite professor.
